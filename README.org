* What is auto-space-mode?

=auto-space-mode= is a package that automatically adds spaces between Chinese characters and English words. This behavior ONLY occurs during input.

* How to use auto-space-mode?

Simply download =auto-space-mode.el= and place it in your Emacs =load-path= directory. Then, add the following to your config file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'auto-space-mode)
(auto-space-mode t)
#+end_src

* What is the difference between auto-space-mode and pangu-spacing?

There is another package [[https://github.com/coldnew/pangu-spacing][pangu-spacing]], that provides similar functionality. The differences between auto-space-mode and pangu-spacing are:

1. =auto-space-mode= ONLY adds spaces during input; it does NOT modify other parts of your document.
2. =auto-space-mode= adds ACTUAL spaces instead of using overlays.
